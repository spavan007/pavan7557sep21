<h4>Sericulture</h4>
<p> Karnataka is the homeland of Mysore Silk. Karnataka sericulture has a history of more than 215 years.It involves rearing of silkworms for the production of raw silk, which is the yarn obtained out of cocoons spun by certain species of insects.  Cultivation to feed the silkworms that spin silk cocoons and reeling the cocoons to unwind the silk filament for value added advantages like process and weaving are the major activities of sericulture. Silk has been blended with the life and culture of the Indians.
<br>India is the second largest producer of silk within the globe. Among the four kinds of silk created in 2015-16, Mulberry accounts for 71.8% (20,434 MT), Tasar 9.9% (2,818 MT), Eri 17.8% (5,054 MT) and Muga 0.6% (166 MT) of the total raw silk production of 28,472 MT.
<br><br> Mulberry sericulture is principally practised in 5 states i.e. Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Assam and Bodoland, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu are major silk producing states in the country. North East has the distinctive distinction of being the sole region manufacturing four kinds of silk like Mulberry, Oak Tasar, Muga and Eri. Overall NE region contributes eighteen of India's total silk production.

<h4>Advantages of Sericulture</h4>
<p><b style="color:Green">Eco-friendly Activity:</b> -As a perennial crop with good foliage and root-spread, mulberry contributes to conservation and provides green cover.
<br>-Waste from silkworm rearing will be recycled as inputs to garden.
<br>-Dried mulberry twigs and branches are used as fuel in place of firewood and therefore reduce the pressure on vegetation/forest.
<br>-Developmental programmes initiated for mulberry plantation are mainly in upland areas where un-used cultivable land is made productive.
<br>-Currently, only concerning 0.1 % of the cultivable land in the country is beneath mulberry cultivation.

<br><br><b style="color:Green">Women friendly Occupation:</b>Women constitutes over hour of those employed in down-stream activities of sericulture in the country. This is the result of sericulture activities ranging from mulberry garden management, leaf harvesting and silkworm rearing is more effectively taken up by the women folks. Even silk reeling business together with weaving is largely supported by them. 
<br><br><b style="color:Green">Low Gestation, High Returns:</b> -Estimated investments of Rs.12,000 to 15,000 (excluding cost of land and rearing space) is adequate for undertaking mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing in one acre of irrigated land.
<br> -Five crops can be taken in one year under tropical conditions.
<br> -It takes only six months for mulberry to grow for commencement of silkworm rearing. Once planted, it will go on supporting silkworm rearing year after year for 15-20 years depending on inputs and management provided.

<h4>Mulberry cultivation</h4>
<p>Sericulture is a prime commercial crop of Karnataka; it creates lots of employment and also a highly profitable crodiv. Naturally mulberry leaves is the only food of Silkworms, its growth depends on the supply of all the nutrients through this.
  <br><b style="color:Green">General Discription:</b>  – Mulberry is a fast growing deciduous woody perennial plant. It has a deep-root system. The leaves are simple, alternate, stipulate, petiolate, entire or lobed. Number of lobes varies from 1 to 5. Plants are generally dioecious. Inflorescence is catkin with pendent or drooping peduncle bearing unisexual flowers. Inflorescence is always auxiliary. <br>
  Male catkins are usually longer than the female catkins. Male flowers are loosely arranged and after shedding the pollen, the inflorescence dries and falls off. Number of parianth lobes are 4. Number of stamens are 4 and implexed in bud. Female inflorescence is usually short and the flowers are very compactly arranged. Number of parianth lobes are 4 and persistent. Ovary is one-celled and stigma is bifid. The chief pollinating agent in mulberry is wind. Fruit is a sorosis and the colour of the fruit is mainly violet black.
<br><br><b style="color:Green">Mulberry Leaf Production:</b>  Production and Quality of Mulberry leaf mainly depends on variety used, soil fertility, cultivation practices adopted, diseases and pest management practices adopted during the crop. Following this methods mulberry leaf production and quality can be improved year by year and made in to a sustainable crop.

<br><br><b style="color:Green">Climatic Requirement of Mulberry:</b> -Mulberry thrives under various climatic conditions ranging from temperate to tropic located north of equator between 28° N to 55°N latitude. The ideal range of temperature is from 24-28°C. It grows well in places with annual rainfall ranging from 600mm to 2500mm. In area with low rainfall, the growth is limited due to moisture stress resulting in low yields.
<br> On an average mulberry requires 85,000 gallons of water per hectare once every 10 days in case of loamy soils and 15 days in clayey soils. The atmospheric humidity in the range of 65-80% is ideally suited for mulberry growth.
<br><br><b style="color:Green">Soil Condition:</b> -Mulberry flourishes well in soils which are flat, deep, fertile, well drained, loamy to clayey, porous with good moisture holding capacity. The ideal range of soil pH is 6.2 to 6.8. The optimum pH required for mulberry is 6.5 to 6.8. Soil amendments may be used to correct the soil to get required pH.

<h4>Establishment of mulberry under rainfed conditions</h4>
<p> <b style="color:Green">Land Preparation:</b> -Land for mulberry cultivation is ploughed deep with a heavy mould board plough up to a depth of 30-35 cm. Thereafter the land is repeatedly ploughed two or three times with a country plough to bring the soil to a fine tilth. The land should be properly levelled. A basal dose of welldecomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost is applied at the rate of 10 tonnes/ha and thoroughly incorporated into the soil.
<br><b style="color:Green">Spacing:</b>-The spacing commonly followed for a rainfed garden is 90 x 90 cm Pits of 35 x 35 cm are prepared. About 1 kg FYM/pit should be added.
<br><br> <b style="color:Green"> Stakes and planting:</b>-Branches of 8-10 months old and about 50 mm in diameter should be used for the preparation of stakes of 22-25 cm length with five to six healthy buds. Three stakes are planted per pit in a triangular form with a spacing of 15 cm, leaving only one bud exposed above soil surface. If planting is done with saplings, then one sapling is sufficient perpit. Planting should be done during June/July after the onset of the monsoon.
<br> <b style="color:Green">Intercultivation:</b> -During the first year, intercultivation should be done manually. Once mulberry plants are established, bullock ploughing is carried out.
<br><br> <b style="color:Green">Fertilization:</b> -50N:25P:25K (kg/ha/year) in two doses. First dose: suphala (15:15:15) 167 kg, after 2 months of planting. Second dose: urea 55 kg or cam (100 kg) or ammonium sulfonate (125 kg), at end of September or early October before cessation of monsoon rains.

<h4>Establishment of mulberry under irrigted conditions</h4>
<p> <b style="color:Green">Selection of site:</b> -Mulberry flourishes well in soils that are flat, deep, fertile, well drained, loamy to clayey, and porous with a good moisture holding capacity. The ideal range of soil pH is 6.2 to 6.8. Mulberry can be grown in saline, alkaline and acidic soils after suitably amending the soils.
<br><b style="color:Green">Preparation of land:</b>-Land for mulberry cultivation is ploughed deep with heavy mould board plough up to a depth of 30-35 cm. Thereafter the land is repeatedly ploughed tw or three times with a country plough to bring the soil to a fine tilth. The land should be properly levelled. A basal dose of welldecomposed FYM or compost is applied at the rate of 20 tonnes/ha and thoroughly incorporated into the soil.
<br> <br><b style="color:Green">Planting:</b> -Plantations can be raised by using both cuttings and saplings. The varieties ideally suited for irrigated conditions are Kanva-2, S-36 and V-1. Branches of 6-9 months old and about 15 ml in diameter should be used for the preparation of cuttings of 15-18 cm in length with three to four healthy buds for raising in the nursery or for planting directly in the field.
<br><b style="color:Green">Spacing:</b> -Plant spacing of 90 x 90 cm is ideal for mulberry. Two cuttings per pit to be used for direct planting. When using saplings, only one sapling/pit is necessary. A paired row plantation with spacing of (90 + 150) cm x 60 cm, is recommended.
<br><br><b style="color:Green">Irrigation:</b> -The plantation should be taken up during the onset of the monsoon to take advantage of the rain. If the rain is not sufficient, the land should be irrigated at regular intervals of 8-14 days depending on the type of soil. About one and a half to two acre inches of water is required/irrigation.
<br><b style="color:Green">Fertilization:</b> -The total dose of fertilizer to be applied in the first year is 100 N: 50 P: 50 K/kg/ha/year. This is applied in two doses. The first dose is applied when the plantation is about two months old at the rate of 50 N: 50 P: 50 K/kg/ha. The second dose is applied after leaf harvesting at the rate of 50 kg N/ha.
